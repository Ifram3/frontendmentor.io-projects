## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (for color palette and variables)
- Flexbox (for layout and alignment)
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design with media queries
- Custom web fonts using @font-face
- Favicon for better branding
- Consistent design spacing using CSS gap & padding

### What I learned

- **Flex-Sizing**: I deepened my understanding of how **flex-grow**, **flex-shrink**, and **flex-basis** work together and how their shorthand property **flex** simplifies responsive layouts.

```css
.label {
    flex: 0 0 6.25rem;
}

.value {
    flex: 1;
}
```
This helped me align text perfectly in my nutrition section without using traditional table elements.

### Continued development

- **Flexbox mastery**: I want to keep refining my understanding of how flex sizing behaves in different contexts, especially when combining flex-basis, min-width, and max-width.

- **CSS layout systems**: As time goes on, I’d like to explore CSS Grid to handle more complex layouts that go beyond one-dimensional flex arrangements.
